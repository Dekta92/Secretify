# Project Title

A simple program I'm writing in C++ to encrypt and decrypt files so that I can better understand encryption techniques and algorithms

## Description

Currently I only have Caesar cipher and I'm working on adding Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption

### Future encryption standards I'm planning on adding

* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Twofish
* Triple DES
* Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

### How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/Dekta92/Secretify
cd Secretify
g++ main.cpp && ./a.out

```
